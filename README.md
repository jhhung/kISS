# kISS: k-ordered Induced Suffix Sorting

k-ordered Induced Suffix Sorting (kISS) is an algorithm tailored to efficiently construct and leverage k-ordered FM-indexes, particularly for high-speed read mapping in extensive genome datasets. The innovation behind k-ordered FM-indexes aims to enhance the efficiency and speed of pattern matching tasks in genomics. kISS achieves this by integrating state-of-the-art induced-sorting-based suffix array construction, capitalizing on its superior time and speed complexities.

## Requirement
To use kISS, ensure the following components are available:
- GNU g++ version 11 or later
- cmake version 3.18.0 or higher
- boost version 1.74.0 or higher

## Installation Steps
Begin by installing necessary dependencies:
```
sudo apt install g++-11 cmake make libboost-all-dev
```

Clone the kISS repository and navigate to the build directory, and generate build files using CMake and compile the project:
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jhhung/kISS
cd kISS
cmake -B build
make -C build
```
